Welcome to my project for Advanced Topics in Programming!

  For this class I decided I wanted to create a program using speech recognition and this is the project I decided upon. 
  This project is my attempt at a simple Alexa Clone. 
  
  It uses Google Clouds Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs for its core functionality and uses a mix of other APIs 
to get responses for certain questions it may be asked. 

  If the user requests a command or action that is not specifically defined then the input gets sent to ChatGPT as a sort
of safety net in order to always give a response to the user.

  This project is designed to be ran on a Raspberry Pi 3 for its "Deployment" which has successfully been completed.
